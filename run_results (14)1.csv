Fold cookie in half, pinching at top to form loose semicircle. Insert index fingers into ends; press indentation into center of cookie while bending ends together to form shape of a fortune cookie. This should take about 10 seconds. Once the cookie hardens, you cannot fold it. Repeat with other cookies. Write your message on long strips of sturdy art paper, and thread through cooled cookie."
